# Requirements
Please install the following packages (ebuild TBA):

Package             | USE flags
------------------- | ---------
dev-util/cmake      |
dev-db/sqlite       | static-libs
dev-libs/capstone   |
dev-lang/python:3.4 |
dev-libs/openssl    |
dev-qt/qtcore       |
dev-qt/qtwidgets    |
dev-cpp/gtest       |

GCC and GNU make are also required, but should (will) already be installed.


# Compile

To compile mycroft, execute the following sequence of commands:
* `git clone --recursive https://github.com/nyxxxie/mycroft.git`
* `mkdir mycroft/build`
* `cd mycroft/build`
* `cmake ..`
* `make`

If nothing fails, mycroft should have been compiled and the client executable
will be located in `build/src/client/qt`.  If you experience any problems when
following this process, PLEASE open an issue about it.

# Install
The makefile generated by cmake in the `mycroft/build` has an install target.
To install, run `make install`.  You can control where mycroft will be
installed to by passing the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=prefix` to cmake when
running the above cmake command, where prefix is the directory to install to.
For example, to install systemwide prefix should be `/usr/share`.
The QT client follow the XDG directory standard, and will look for plugins,
configs, etc inside of `$HOME/.config/mycroft`.
